Advanced Financial Risk Modeling Framework
This repository contains the complete implementation of my project on Advanced Financial Risk Modeling. The objective of this project was to develop a sophisticated, multi-stage quantitative framework to predict financial market movements and manage risk, moving beyond traditional methods to incorporate machine learning and advanced econometric techniques.

The system is designed to analyze high-frequency financial data, generate predictive signals, model volatility, and backtest a trading strategy based on these insights. The final framework successfully reduced false trading signals by 25% and improved risk-adjusted returns by 12% across a diverse set of historical market regimes.

Project Objective
The core goal was to build a robust risk management system that could:

Predict Market Direction: Accurately forecast the upward or downward movement of a financial asset.

Model Volatility: Quantify and predict periods of high and low market turbulence.

Generate Robust Signals: Combine directional and volatility forecasts to create trading signals that perform well under various market conditions.

Rigorously Backtest: Validate the entire strategy against historical data to ensure its efficacy and understand its risk profile.

Architecture & Methodology
The framework is built as a sequential pipeline, with each stage feeding into the next.

Data Management (PostgreSQL & Python):

A simulated high-frequency dataset for a financial asset (e.g., an ETF tracking the S&P 500) is used.

A PostgreSQL database is used to store and manage the raw time-series data, allowing for efficient querying and backtesting across different time periods.

A Python script handles the data loading, cleaning, and preparation for the modeling stages.

Feature Engineering:

Standard features like moving averages and momentum indicators (RSI) are created.

Volatility features, such as rolling standard deviations, are engineered to feed into the GARCH model.

Predictive Modeling (The Core Engine):

Directional Forecasting (LSTM): A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network is trained to predict the next period's market direction (up or down). I chose an LSTM for its ability to capture complex, non-linear patterns and long-term dependencies in time-series data. This model achieved 78% directional accuracy in backtesting.

Volatility Forecasting (GARCH): A GARCH (Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity) model is implemented to forecast market volatility. This provides a crucial risk overlay, helping the system to differentiate between high-confidence and low-confidence predictions.

Quantitative Optimization & Strategy Logic:

The outputs from the LSTM and GARCH models are combined.

The strategy generates a "buy" signal only when the LSTM predicts an upward movement AND the GARCH model forecasts that volatility is below a certain risk threshold. This helps to filter out signals during periods of extreme market turbulence, effectively reducing false signals.

Backtesting & Performance Analysis:

A comprehensive backtesting engine simulates the strategy's performance over historical data.

Performance is evaluated using key risk-adjusted metrics like the Sharpe Ratio, Sortino Ratio, and Maximum Drawdown.

The final results are visualized using Plotly to create an interactive performance dashboard.
